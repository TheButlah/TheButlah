# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Rust developer, passionate about building realtime systems. I do a lot of open
source VR development, especially for full-body motion tracking in games like VRChat.

I also like to dance and go bouldering.


## Hire Me ðŸ”¥

I build you something awesome, in exchange for monies. Its a win win :)
You can contact at [rjbutler.main@gmail.com](mailto:rjbutler.main@gmail.com).

Please note that I am currently prioritizing positions in which the majority of time is
spent writing Rust.

If you would like to support my open source projects, you can find me at
[ko-fi.com/thebutlah](https://ko-fi.com/thebutlah).


## Current Projects

### SlimeVR

I have three main things I am working on under this umbrella, all of which are located
in my [SlimeVR-Rust](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Rust) monorepo or in 
[SolarXR](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SolarXR-Protocol).
